                <b>Welcome Announcement to Math 1101</b>
                <br><br>
                Welcome to College Algebra! I am looking forward to being your instructor for the upcoming term. A few
                items I want to make you aware of as you start the class: the Orientation module must be completed
                before you can begin working on the rest of the course material. In the orientation module you can find
                the syllabus with all of the information regarding grades, due dates, class expectations, and how to
                navigate within this course. Each week you should complete one module. Homework assignments and
                discussions should be completed by Saturday at 11:59 pm each week. Discussions require you to respond to
                at least two of your classmates. These responses are due each Monday by 11:59 pm.
                Quiz 2 has been moved to Friday 1/22. Please email me if you have any questions
                RE: Extra Credit Opportunities
                <br><br>
                Hey Folks,
                <br><br>
                Many of you have asked about extra credit opportunities in this class. I wanted to give you a couple
                options that are related to the presentation aspect of the course.
                <br><br>
                1. Speakers’ Showcase
                <br><br>
                Each semester I have special opportunity to choose one of you to represent our class at the Speakers’
                Showcase. All communications professors can nominate one student to submit their best speech. If you are
                nominated you will receive extra credit. In addition, a panel of judges will choose the top six
                presentations to be in the Showcase. If you are chosen to be in the Showcase, you will receive
                additional extra credit and possibly money or prizes. This is a win-win! The next showcase is April
                26th. Your presentation videos will be due April 17th.
                Here are the results for our first exam:
                Average: 82
                Mean: 80
                Standard Deviation 8.9

             Hello Class,
             <br><br>

The test will be available tomorrow from 3:30pm to 11:59pm.
You can use scratch paper. Please write clearly and number appropriately when you write on the scratch paper for a chance to scan and uploading the scratch paper in webassign for a chance to earn partial credit on the questions you will have answered. 
You will upload in Assignments
You will have a limited time to upload the scratch paper - maximum 20 minutes after you finish doing the test. I will check the time. 
Good luck!

            Hello Class,<br><br>

A project has been posted in E-learn. To access: click assignments from the top navbar and submit.
<br> <br>
The project is due at 11:59 pm on 10 july 2020
<br> <br>
Please note:
<br> <br>
Whereas a correct answer is desirable, the purpose of this task is for you to show how to get the solution. It is not just about the answer. You need to show the process to get to the answer.
<br> <br>
You are expected to do this task on your own, with no assistance from anyone. However, you may use the textbook and may ask for assistance from your instructor should you need some clarifications.
