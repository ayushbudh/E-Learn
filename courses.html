                <b>Welcome Announcement to Math 1101</b>
                <br><br>
                Welcome to College Algebra! I am looking forward to being your instructor for the upcoming term. A few
                items I want to make you aware of as you start the class: the Orientation module must be completed
                before you can begin working on the rest of the course material. In the orientation module you can find
                the syllabus with all of the information regarding grades, due dates, class expectations, and how to
                navigate within this course. Each week you should complete one module. Homework assignments and
                discussions should be completed by Saturday at 11:59 pm each week. Discussions require you to respond to
                at least two of your classmates. These responses are due each Monday by 11:59 pm.
                Quiz 2 has been moved to Friday 1/22. Please email me if you have any questions
                RE: Extra Credit Opportunities
                <br><br>
                Hey Folks,
                <br><br>
                Many of you have asked about extra credit opportunities in this class. I wanted to give you a couple
                options that are related to the presentation aspect of the course.
                <br><br>
                1. Speakers’ Showcase
                <br><br>
                Each semester I have special opportunity to choose one of you to represent our class at the Speakers’
                Showcase. All communications professors can nominate one student to submit their best speech. If you are
                nominated you will receive extra credit. In addition, a panel of judges will choose the top six
                presentations to be in the Showcase. If you are chosen to be in the Showcase, you will receive
                additional extra credit and possibly money or prizes. This is a win-win! The next showcase is April
                26th. Your presentation videos will be due April 17th.
                Here are the results for our first exam:
                Average: 82
                Mean: 80
                Standard Deviation 8.9
